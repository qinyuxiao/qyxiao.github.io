I am an M.Phil. candidate at the Department of Psychology, University of Hong Kong. I am interested in morality, social cognition, and judgment and decision-making, and seeking to apply these knowledges to environmental/political issues. I am a keen supporter of open science and replication studies.

I like hiking, reading detective novels, watching Japanese dramas, learning languages, and house cleaning (when pressure accumulates). Other than English, I speak Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese, and German.
