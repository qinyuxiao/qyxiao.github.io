I am a Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.) candidate at the Department of Psychology, University of Hong Kong. I am broadly interested in morality, behavioral ethics, judgment and decision-making, and social cognition. I aspire to apply findings in these areas to practical realms to promote collective good (e.g., environmental conservation, animal welfare, gender equality). I have been practicing open science since the first day of my academic training. I understand science as a cumulative endeavor, and I value replicability, reproducibility, robustness, and generality of results over their novelty.

I like hiking, reading detective novels (my favorite writers are Ellery Queen and Soji Shimada), watching Japanese dramas, learning languages, and house cleaning (when pressure accumulates). Other than English, I speak Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese, and German.
