I graduated from the University of Hong Kong (HKU) with a bachelor’s degree (B.A.) in psychology and philosophy and a research master’s degree (M.Phil.) in social psychology. I am broadly interested in morality, judgment and decision-making, social cognition, and how findings in these fields can be applied to promote collective good and increase people’s well-being. I strongly support open science.
