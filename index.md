I graduated from the University of Hong Kong (HKU) with a bachelor’s degree (B.A.) in psychology and philosophy and a research master’s degree (M.Phil.) in social psychology. I am broadly interested in morality, judgment and decision-making, social cognition, and how findings in these fields can be applied to promote collective good and increase people’s well-being. I strongly support open science.

At present, I collaborate closely with [Gilad Feldman](https://mgto.org), my M.Phil. supervisor, on several replication-extension and meta-science projects. I also work with [Nadira Faber](http://nadirafaber.com/sobe) as a research intern on a project related to moral judgments about animals and technology.

In 2021-22, I will work as a temporary instructional assistant at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. I will assist the teaching of a common core course about critical thinking and data literacy.

I am actively looking for PhD opportunities starting in 2022. If there is any opening broadly relevant to my research interests, I will be happy and grateful to know. :)
