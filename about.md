I am a Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.) candidate at the Department of Psychology, University of Hong Kong. I am broadly interested in morality, behavioral ethics, judgment and decision-making, and social cognition. I aspire to apply findings in these areas to practical realms to promote collective good (e.g., environmental conservation, animal welfare, gender equality). I have been practicing open science since the first day of my academic training. I understand science as a cumulative endeavor, and I value replicability, reproducibility, robustness, and generality of results over their novelty.

### About Me

#### Background

I graduated from the University of Hong Kong in 2018, with a B.A. in Psychology and Philosophy (1st Class Honours). I am currently working with **[Dr. Gilad Feldman](http://mgto.org/)** at HKU as an M.Phil. student (currently in my second and last year). I am actively looking for Ph.D. opportunities around the world.
