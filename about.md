I am an M.Phil. candidate at the Department of Psychology, University of Hong Kong. I am interested in morality, social cognition, and judgment and decision-making, and seeking to apply these knowledges to environmental/political issues. I am a keen supporter of open science and replication studies.

### About Me

#### Background

I graduated from the University of Hong Kong in 2018, with a B.A. in Psychology and Philosophy. I am currently working with **[Gilad Feldman](http://mgto.org/)** at HKU as an M.Phil. student (currently in my second and last year). I am actively looking for Ph.D. opportunities around the world.
